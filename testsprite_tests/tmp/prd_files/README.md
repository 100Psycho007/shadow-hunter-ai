## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-threat-hunting-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create reports directory** (if it doesn't exist)
   ```bash
   mkdir reports
   ```

4. **Optional: Configure AI Integration**
   
   To enable AI-powered threat summaries, set your OpenRouter API key:
   
   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```cmd
   set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```powershell
   $env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
   
   **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   You can obtain an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

## Usage

### Starting the Dashboard

1. **Launch the Streamlit application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

2. **Access the dashboard**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The dashboard will automatically load any JSON reports from the `/reports/` directory

### Report Format

Place your reconnaissance reports in the `/reports/` directory as JSON files. The expected schema is:

```json
{
  "target": "example.com",
  "scan_date": "2025-01-02",
  "subdomains": [
    "www.example.com",
    "api.example.com",
    "admin.example.com"
  ],
  "open_ports": {
    "80": "http",
    "443": "https",
    "22": "ssh"
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "title": "Outdated Server Version",
      "description": "Server running outdated Apache version",
      "affected_service": "http",
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-12345"
    }
  ],
  "ai_summary": null
}
```

### Using the Dashboard

1. **View KPI Summary**: Check the top cards for quick statistics
2. **Apply Filters**: Use the sidebar to filter by targets, dates, or keywords
3. **Explore Visualizations**: Analyze patterns in the interactive charts
4. **Review Detailed Reports**: Click on table rows to expand full details
5. **Generate AI Summaries**: Click "AI Summary" buttons for threat analysis (requires API key)

## Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:

- **streamlit** (>=1.28.0): Web application framework
- **plotly** (>=5.15.0): Interactive visualization library
- **pandas** (>=2.0.0): Data manipulation and analysis
- **requests** (>=2.31.0): HTTP library for API calls

See `requirements.txt` for complete dependency list with version specifications.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

### Directory Structure

- **`/reports/`**: Place your JSON reconnaissance reports here
- **`/assets/`**: Static assets like logos and images
- **`/src/`**: Core application modules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dashboard won't start**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check for port conflicts on 8501

**No reports showing**
- Verify JSON files are in the `/reports/` directory
- Check JSON file format matches expected schema
- Look for error messages in the Streamlit console

**AI summaries not working**
- Verify `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check API key validity at OpenRouter dashboard
- Ensure internet connection for API calls

**Performance issues with large datasets**
- Consider filtering reports by date range
- Check available system memory
- Use pagination for very large report sets

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Streamlit console for error messages
2. Verify your JSON report format matches the expected schema
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. Check that the `/reports/` directory exists and contains valid files
